#### Ideas
1. The main character travels to a future where the french revolution did not happen because napoleons parents never moved to france. The main character must travel back in time to prevent the french revolution from not happening. 
    - **Diversifiers**: 
      - Once upon a 404...: Create a game that focuses or centers on the disappearance of information surrounding historical events and/or stories of underrepresented communities. 
2. You play as a corrupting mycelium that is trying to spread its roots throughout the world(game world). The npcs are trying to stop you from spreading. 
3. Groots younger brother Vroot is trying to find his brother. He must travel through time to find him. 
4. Root of a tree in a computer sense. The main character is a computer virus that is trying to get to the root node of a data structure.
5. The main character is a tree that is trying to grow roots. The roots are the main characters limbs. The main character must grow roots to survive.
6. You are a tree that doesnt want to grow roots. Your constantly growing roots, and if you stand still for too long you become rooted and the game is over. You can use the root mechanic to your advantage to get around obstacles and traverse the world. This is a platformer metrovania style game.
