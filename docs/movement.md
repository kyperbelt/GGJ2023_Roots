Wanted vroot to move slower the longer he stood still but I did not want it to be done in a linear fashion. I used desmos to look for a good curve to use and found this one: 

$$f\left(x\right)\ =\ 1-\left(1\ -\ .9x\right)^{2}$$
Which gives me the value between 0 and .99 for any value of x between 0 and 1. I then multiplied this value by the speed I wanted the vroot to move at and that gave me the speed I wanted the vroot to move at.

The value of x is calculated by taking the time that vroot has been standing still dividided by the max time he can stand still.
$$x\ =\ \frac{time\ standing\ still}{max\ time\ standing\ still}$$
